\arguments{
\item{selectyears}{Years to be returned}

\item{cells}{Number of cells to be returned
(select "magpiecell" for 59199 cells or "lpjcell" for 67420 cells)}

\item{datasource}{Data source to be used (e.g. WATERGAP2020)}

\item{usetype}{water use types (domestic, industry, electricity)
and option to return withdrawals or consumption
separated by ":" (e.g. "all:withdrawal")
options for first argument:
"total" (returns the sum over different
water use types) or
"all" ( returns all water use types
(domestic, industry, electricity))
options for second argument: "all", "withdrawal", "consumption"}

\item{seasonality}{grper (default): non-agricultural water demand in growing period per year;
total: non-agricultural water demand throughout the year}

\item{harmonType}{Type of time smoothing:
average (average over 8-year time span around baseline year) or
spline (time smoothing using spline method with 4 degrees of freedom) or
NULL (no smoothing)}

\item{lpjml}{Defines LPJmL version for crop/grass and natveg specific inputs}

\item{climatetype}{Switch between different climate scenarios for calcGrowingPeriod}
