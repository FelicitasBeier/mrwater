\arguments{
\item{selectyears}{Years to be returned}

\item{output}{Water availability output to be returned: withdrawal or consumption}

\item{finalcells}{Number of cells to be returned by the function (lpjcell: 67420, magpiecell: 59199)}

\item{lpjml}{LPJmL version required for respective inputs: natveg or crop. Note: Default version arguments need to be updated when new versions are used!}

\item{climatetype}{Switch between different climate scenarios or historical baseline "GSWP3-W5E5:historical"}

\item{allocationrule}{Rule to be applied for river basin discharge allocation across cells of river basin ("optimization" (default), "upstreamfirst", "equality")}

\item{allocationshare}{Share of water to be allocated to cell (only needs to be selected in case of allocationrule=="equality")}

\item{thresholdtype}{Thresholdtype of yield improvement potential required for water allocation in upstreamfirst algorithm: TRUE (default): monetary yield gain (USD05/ha), FALSE: yield gain in tDM/ha}

\item{gainthreshold}{Threshold of yield improvement potential required for water allocation in upstreamfirst algorithm (in tons per ha)}

\item{irrigationsystem}{Irrigation system to be used for river basin discharge allocation algorithm ("surface", "sprinkler", "drip", "initialization")}

\item{irrigini}{When "initialization" selected for irrigation system: choose initialization data set for irrigation system initialization ("Jaegermeyr_lpjcell", "LPJmL_lpjcell")}

\item{iniyear}{Initialization year of irrigation system}

\item{proxycrop}{historical crop mix pattern ("historical") or list of proxycrop(s)}
