\arguments{
\item{x_axis_range}{range of x-axis (gainthreshold) to be depicted on the curve}

\item{scenario}{non-agricultural water use scenario to be displayed in plot}

\item{output}{output type to be displayed: irrigated area "IrrigArea" or available water volume "wat_ag_ww" "wat_ag_wc" "wat_tot_ww" "wat_tot_wc"}

\item{lpjml}{LPJmL version required for respective inputs: natveg or crop}

\item{selectyears}{years for which irrigatable area is calculated}

\item{climatetype}{Switch between different climate scenarios or historical baseline "GSWP3-W5E5:historical"}

\item{EFRmethod}{EFR method used including selected strictness of EFRs (e.g. Smakhtin:good, VMF:fair)}

\item{gainthreshold}{Threshold of yield improvement potential required for water allocation in upstreamfirst algorithm (in tons per ha)}

\item{rankmethod}{method of calculating the rank: "meancellrank" (default): mean over cellrank of proxy crops, "meancroprank": rank over mean of proxy crops (normalized), "meanpricedcroprank": rank over mean of proxy crops (normalized using price), "watervalue": rank over value of irrigation water; and fullpotentail TRUE/FALSE separated by ":" (TRUE: Full irrigation potential (cell receives full irrigation requirements in total area). FALSE: reduced potential of cell receives at later stage in allocation algorithm)}

\item{yieldcalib}{FAO (LPJmL yields calibrated with current FAO yield) or calibrated (LPJmL yield potentials harmonized to baseline and calibrated for proxycrops) or none (smoothed LPJmL yield potentials, not harmonized, not calibrated)}

\item{allocationrule}{Rule to be applied for river basin discharge allocation across cells of river basin ("optimization" (default), "upstreamfirst", "equality")}

\item{thresholdtype}{Thresholdtype of yield improvement potential required for water allocation in upstreamfirst algorithm: TRUE (default): monetary yield gain (USD05/ha), FALSE: yield gain in tDM/ha}

\item{irrigationsystem}{Irrigation system to be used for river basin discharge allocation algorithm ("surface", "sprinkler", "drip", "initialization")}

\item{avlland_scen}{Land availability scenario: current or potential; optional additionally: protection scenario in case of potential (when left empty: no protection) and initialization year of cropland area
combination of land availability scenario and initialization year separated by ":". land availability scenario: currIrrig (only currently irrigated cropland available for irrigated agriculture), currCropland (only current cropland areas available for irrigated agriculture), potIrrig (suitable land is available for irrigated agriculture, potentially land restrictions activated through protect_scen argument)
protection scenario separated by "_" (only relevant when potIrrig selected): WDPA, BH, FF, CPD, LW, HalfEarth. Areas where no irrigation water withdrawals are allowed due to biodiversity protection.}

\item{proxycrop}{proxycrop(s) selected for crop mix specific calculations: average over proxycrop(s) yield gain. NULL returns all crops individually}

\item{com_ag}{if TRUE: the currently already irrigated areas in initialization year are reserved for irrigation, if FALSE: no irrigation areas reserved (irrigation potential)}

\item{multicropping}{Multicropping activated (TRUE) or not (FALSE)}

\item{potential_wat}{if TRUE: potential available water and areas used, if FALSE: currently reserved water on current irrigated cropland used}
