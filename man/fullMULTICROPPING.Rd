\usage{
fullMULTICROPPING(
  cropmix = c("maiz", "rapeseed", "puls_pro"),
  yieldcalib = "TRUE:TRUE:actual:irrig_crop",
  allocationrule = "optimization",
  rankmethod = "USD_ha:GLO:TRUE",
  transDist = 100
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cropmix}{Selected cropmix (options:
"hist_irrig" for historical cropmix on currently irrigated area,
"hist_total" for historical cropmix on total cropland,
or selection of proxycrops)}

\item{yieldcalib}{If TRUE: LPJmL yields calibrated to FAO country yield in iniyear
        Also needs specification of refYields, separated by ":".
        Options: FALSE (for single cropping analyses) or
                 "TRUE:actual:irrig_crop" (for multiple cropping analyses)
If FALSE: uncalibrated LPJmL yields are used}

\item{allocationrule}{Rule to be applied for river basin discharge allocation
across cells of river basin ("optimization", "upstreamfirst")}

\item{rankmethod}{Rank and optimization method consisting of
Unit according to which rank is calculated:
USD_ha (USD per hectare) for relative area return, or
USD_m3 (USD per cubic meter) for relative volumetric return;
USD for absolute return (total profit);
USD_m3ha (USD per hectare per cubic meter)
for relative return according to area and volume.
Price aggregation:
"GLO" for global average prices, or
"ISO" for country-level prices
and boolean indicating fullpotential (TRUE, i.e. cell
receives full irrigation requirements in total area)
or reduced potential (FALSE, reduced potential of cell
receives at later stage in allocation algorithm);
separated by ":"}

\item{transDist}{Water transport distance allowed to fulfill locally
unfulfilled water demand by surrounding cell water availability}
}
\description{

             under multiple cropping on cellular resolution.
