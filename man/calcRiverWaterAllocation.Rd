calcRiverWaterAllocation(
  selectyears,
  climatetype,
  allocationrule,
  thresholdtype,
  gainthreshold,
  irrigationsystem,
  iniyear,
  protect_scen
)
}
\arguments{
\item{selectyears}{Years to be returned (Note: does not affect years of harmonization or smoothing)}

\item{climatetype}{Switch between different climate scenarios or historical baseline "GSWP3-W5E5:historical"}

\item{allocationrule}{Rule to be applied for river basin discharge allocation across cells of river basin ("optimization" (default), "upstreamfirst", "equality")}

\item{thresholdtype}{Thresholdtype of yield improvement potential required for water allocation in upstreamfirst algorithm: TRUE (default): monetary yield gain (USD05/ha), FALSE: yield gain in tDM/ha}

\item{gainthreshold}{Threshold of yield improvement potential required for water allocation in upstreamfirst algorithm (in tons per ha)}

\item{irrigationsystem}{Irrigation system to be used for river basin discharge allocation algorithm ("surface", "sprinkler", "drip", "initialization")}

\item{iniyear}{Initialization year of irrigation system}

\item{protect_scen}{land protection scenario: NULL (no irrigation limitation in protected areas), WDPA, BH, FF, CPD, LW, HalfEarth. Areas where no irrigation water withdrawals are allowed due to biodiversity protection}

magpie object in cellular resolution

\description{
This function is the wrapper function of the River-Routing. It returns results from river routing (potential human uses and cellular discharge)
