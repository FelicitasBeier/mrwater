\usage{
toolDischargeAllocation(y, rs, l_inout, l_in, allocationrule, glocellrank)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{Current year of loop}

\item{rs}{River structure (list of river structure details and
cell numbers including ordered cell number)}

\item{l_inout}{List of inputs that are at the same time outputs:
required_wat_min_allocation Minimum (water requirement reserved per grid cell (as magpie object of correct dimension));
discharge (Discharge to be allocated (as magpie object of correct dimension));
frac_fullirrig (fraction of fullirrigation requirements that can be fulfilled)}

\item{l_in}{List of inputs:
irrig_yieldgainpotential (yield gain potential through irrigation of proxy crops: magpie object with cellular and year dimension (as magpie object of correct dimension));
required_wat_fullirrig_ww (required withdrawal for full irrigation in specific cell (as magpie object of correct dimension));
required_wat_fullirrig_wc (required consumption for full irrigation in specific cell (as magpie object of correct dimension));
gainthreshold (Minimum yield gain in USD/ha (as scalar value)); avl_wat_ww; avl_wat_wc}

\item{allocationrule}{Rule to be applied for river basin discharge allocation
across cells of river basin ("optimization", "upstreamfirst")}

\item{glocellrank}{Cell ranking for different years (array).
Note: only applicable when allocationrule "optimization" chosen}
}
\value{
magpie object in cellular resolution
}
\description{
This tool function executes the Allocation Algorithm in
             cell order of selected allocation rule
}
