\arguments{
\item{selectyears}{years for which irrigatable area is calculated}

\item{cells}{cells to be returned by the function (lpjcell or magpiecell)}

\item{output}{Type of area to be returned: irrigatable_area (default, considers both water and land availability), irrig_area_ww or irrig_area_wc (area that can be irrigated given water available for withdrawal or consumption), avl_land, protect_area (restricts water withdrawal in protected areas)}

\item{iniarea}{if TRUE: already irrigated area is subtracted, if FALSE: total potential land area is used from potentially available irrigation land}

\item{protect_scen}{land protection scenario: NULL (no irrigation limitation in protected areas), WDPA, BH, FF, CPD, LW, HalfEarth. Areas where no irrigation water withdrawals are allowed due to biodiversity protection}

\item{climatetype}{Switch between different climate scenarios (default: "CRU_4")}

\item{time}{Time smoothing: average, spline or raw (default)}

\item{averaging_range}{only specify if time=="average": number of time steps to average}

\item{dof}{only specify if time=="spline": degrees of freedom needed for spline}

\item{harmonize_baseline}{FALSE (default): no harmonization, TRUE: if a baseline is specified here data is harmonized to that baseline (from ref_year on)}

\item{ref_year}{Reference year for harmonization baseline (just specify when harmonize_baseline=TRUE)}

\item{allocationrule}{Rule to be applied for river basin discharge allocation across cells of river basin ("optimization" (default), "upstreamfirst", "equality")}

\item{allocationshare}{Share of water to be allocated to cell (only needs to be selected in case of allocationrule=="equality")}

\item{gainthreshold}{Threshold of yield improvement potential required for water allocation in upstreamfirst algorithm (in tons per ha)}

\item{irrigationsystem}{Irrigation system to be used for river basin discharge allocation algorithm ("surface", "sprinkler", "drip", "initialization")}

\item{iniyear}{year of initialization for cropland area initialization and irrigation systems}

\item{landtype}{current cropland area (currentcropland) or potential cropland area (potentialcropland) or nonprotected (restriction of withdrawals in protected areas)}

\item{protectscen}{protection scenario for protected areas ("WDPA", "HalfEarth", )}

\item{proxycrop}{proxycrop(s) selected for crop mix specific calculations: average over proxycrop(s) yield gain. NULL returns all crops individually}
