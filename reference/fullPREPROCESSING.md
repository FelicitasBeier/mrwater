# fullPREPROCESSING

Function that produces the objects for Technical and Economic Irrigation
Potentials within land and water boundaries

## Usage

``` r
fullPREPROCESSING(
  protectLand = "HalfEarth",
  yieldcalib = "TRUE:TRUE:actual:irrig_crop",
  multicropping = "TRUE:potential:endogenous",
  cropmix = "hist_total",
  climatetype = "MRI-ESM2-0:ssp370",
  lpjml = c(natveg = "LPJmL4_for_MAgPIE_44ac93de", crop =
    "ggcmi_phase3_nchecks_9ca735cb")
)
```

## Arguments

- protectLand:

  Land protection scenario (WDPA, or one of the scenarios available in
  calcConservationPriorities, e.g., 30by20, BH, BH_IFL, PBL_HalfEarth,
  or NA for no protection

- yieldcalib:

  If TRUE: LPJmL yields calibrated to FAO country yield in iniyear Also
  needs specification of refYields, separated by ":". Options: FALSE
  (for single cropping analyses) or "TRUE:actual:irrig_crop" (for
  multiple cropping analyses) If FALSE: uncalibrated LPJmL yields are
  used

- multicropping:

  Multicropping activated (TRUE) or not (FALSE) and Multiple Cropping
  Suitability mask selected (mask can be: "none": no mask applied (only
  for development purposes) "actual:total": currently multicropped areas
  calculated from total harvested areas and total physical areas per
  cell from LandInG "actual:crop" (crop-specific), "actual:irrigation"
  (irrigation-specific), "actual:irrig_crop" (crop- and
  irrigation-specific) "total" "potential:endogenous": potentially
  multicropped areas given temperature and productivity limits
  "potential:exogenous": potentially multicropped areas given GAEZ
  suitability classification) (e.g. TRUE:actual:total; TRUE:none; FALSE)

- cropmix:

  Selected cropmix (options: "hist_irrig" for historical cropmix on
  currently irrigated area, "hist_total" for historical cropmix on total
  cropland, or selection of proxycrops)

- climatetype:

  Switch between different climate scenarios or historical baseline
  "GSWP3-W5E5:historical"

- lpjml:

  LPJmL version required for respective inputs: natveg or crop
