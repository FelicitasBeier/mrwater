# calcNonrenGroundwatUse

Calculates current non-renewable (fossil) groundwater use as negative
difference between water availability from renewable sources and human
water use (consumption and withdrawal). The water use in the
initialization year is fixed in the future as non-renewable groundwater.

## Usage

``` r
calcNonrenGroundwatUse(
  output,
  lpjml,
  climatetype,
  transDistGW = 100,
  multicropping = "TRUE:actual:irrig_crop",
  selectyears,
  iniyear
)
```

## Arguments

- output:

  "total": total groundwater use (non-agricultural and agricultural),
  "nonAg": groundwater use in non-agricultural sector (industry,
  domestic, electricity), "comAg": groundwater use in agricultural
  sector (currently irrigated area)

- lpjml:

  LPJmL version used

- climatetype:

  Switch between different climate scenarios or historical baseline
  "GSWP3-W5E5:historical"

- transDistGW:

  Water transport distance allowed to fulfill locally unfulfilled water
  demand by surrounding cell water availability to determine missing
  water that is tagged as non-renewable groundwater

- multicropping:

  Multicropping activated (TRUE) or not (FALSE) and Multiple Cropping
  Suitability mask selected (mask can be: "none": no mask applied (only
  for development purposes) "actual:total": currently multicropped areas
  calculated from total harvested areas and total physical areas per
  cell from LandInG "actual:crop" (crop-specific), "actual:irrigation"
  (irrigation-specific), "actual:irrig_crop" (crop- and
  irrigation-specific) "total" "potential:endogenous": potentially
  multicropped areas given temperature and productivity limits
  "potential:exogenous": potentially multicropped areas given GAEZ
  suitability classification) (e.g. TRUE:actual:total; TRUE:none; FALSE)

- selectyears:

  Years to be returned

- iniyear:

  Initialization year
