# calcYieldsAdjusted

This function returns irrigated and rainfed yields for MAgPIE crops.

## Usage

``` r
calcYieldsAdjusted(
  lpjml,
  climatetype,
  iniyear,
  selectyears,
  yieldcalib,
  multicropping
)
```

## Arguments

- lpjml:

  LPJmL version used

- climatetype:

  Switch between different climate scenarios or historical baseline
  "GSWP3-W5E5:historical" for yields

- iniyear:

  Year to be used for cropland of yield calibration

- selectyears:

  Years to be returned by the function

- yieldcalib:

  If TRUE: LPJmL yields calibrated to FAO country yield in iniyear Also
  needs specification of refYields, separated by ":". Options: FALSE
  (for single cropping analyses) or "TRUE:actual:irrig_crop" (for
  multiple cropping analyses) If FALSE: uncalibrated LPJmL yields are
  used

- multicropping:

  Multicropping activated (TRUE) or not (FALSE) and Multiple Cropping
  Suitability mask selected (mask can be: "none": no mask applied (only
  for development purposes) "actual:total": currently multicropped areas
  calculated from total harvested areas and total physical areas per
  cell from LandInG "actual:crop" (crop-specific), "actual:irrigation"
  (irrigation-specific), "actual:irrig_crop" (crop- and
  irrigation-specific) "total" "potential:endogenous": potentially
  multicropped areas given temperature and productivity limits
  "potential:exogenous": potentially multicropped areas given GAEZ
  suitability classification) (e.g. TRUE:actual:total; TRUE:none; FALSE)
