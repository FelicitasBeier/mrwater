Potentials within land and water boundaries

## Usage

``` r
fullIRRIGATIONPOTENTIAL(
  efrMethod = "VMF:fair",
  accessibilityrule = "CV:2",
  transDist = 0,
  fossilGW = FALSE,
  allocationrule = "optimization",
  rankmethod = "USD_ha:GLO:TRUE",
  gainthreshold = 500,
  protectLand = "HalfEarth",
  yieldcalib = "TRUE:FALSE",

)
```

## Arguments

- efrMethod:

  EFR method used including selected strictness of EFRs (Smakhtin:good,
  VMF:fair)

- accessibilityrule:

  Method used: Quantile method (Q) or Coefficient of Variation (CV)
  combined with scalar value defining the strictness of accessibility
  restriction: discharge that is exceeded x percent of the time on
  average throughout a year (Qx, e.g. Q75: 0.25, Q50: 0.5) or base value
  for exponential curve separated by : (CV:2)

- transDist:

  Water transport distance allowed to fulfill locally unfulfilled water
  demand by surrounding cell water availability

- fossilGW:

  If TRUE: non-renewable groundwater can be used. If FALSE:
  non-renewable groundwater cannot be used.

- allocationrule:

  Rule to be applied for river basin discharge allocation across cells
  of river basin ("optimization", "upstreamfirst")

- rankmethod:

  Rank and optimization method consisting of Unit according to which
  rank is calculated: USD_ha (USD per hectare) for relative area return,
  or USD_m3 (USD per cubic meter) for relative volumetric return; USD
  for absolute return (total profit); Price aggregation: "GLO" for
  global average prices, or "ISO" for country-level prices and boolean
  indicating fullpotential (TRUE, i.e. cell receives full irrigation
  requirements in total area) or reduced potential (FALSE, reduced
  potential of cell receives at later stage in allocation algorithm);
  separated by ":"

- gainthreshold:

  Threshold of yield improvement potential required for water allocation
  in upstreamfirst algorithm (in same unit as in rankmethod)

- protectLand:

  Land protection scenario (WDPA, or one of the scenarios available in
  calcConservationPriorities, e.g., 30by20, BH, BH_IFL, PBL_HalfEarth,
  or NA for no protection).

- yieldcalib:

  If TRUE: LPJmL yields calibrated to FAO country yield in iniyear Also
  needs specification of refYields, separated by ":". Options: FALSE
  (for single cropping analyses) or "TRUE:actual:irrig_crop" (for
  multiple cropping analyses) If FALSE: uncalibrated LPJmL yields are
  used

- multicropping:

  Multicropping activated (TRUE) or not (FALSE) and Multiple Cropping
  Suitability mask selected (mask can be: "none": no mask applied (only
  for development purposes) "actual:total": currently multicropped areas
  calculated from total harvested areas and total physical areas per
  cell from LandInG "actual:crop" (crop-specific), "actual:irrigation"
  (irrigation-specific), "actual:irrig_crop" (crop- and
  irrigation-specific) "total" "potential:endogenous": potentially
  multicropped areas given temperature and productivity limits
  "potential:exogenous": potentially multicropped areas given GAEZ
  suitability classification) (e.g. TRUE:actual:total; TRUE:none; FALSE)

- cropmix:

  Selected cropmix (options: "hist_irrig" for historical cropmix on
  currently irrigated area, "hist_total" for historical cropmix on total
  cropland, or selection of proxycrops)

- climatetype:

  Switch between different climate scenarios or historical baseline
  "GSWP3-W5E5:historical"

- lpjml:

  LPJmL version required for respective inputs: natveg or crop
