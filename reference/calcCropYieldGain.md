# calcCropYieldGain

This function calculates the yield gains per crop through irrigation or
multiple cropping relative to rainfed-single system production
(including negatives)

## Usage

``` r
calcCropYieldGain(
  lpjml,
  climatetype,
  yieldgaintype,
  priceAgg,
  iniyear,
  selectyears,
  yieldcalib,
  multicropping
)
```

## Arguments

- lpjml:

  LPJmL version used for yields

- climatetype:

  Climate scenarios or historical baseline "GSWP3-W5E5:historical"

- yieldgaintype:

  Crop yield gain through multiple cropping under rainfed conditions
  "multicropping_rf", multiple cropping under irrigated conditions
  "multicropping_ir", irrigation under single cropping conditions
  "irrigation_singlecropping" irrigation and multiple cropping
  "irrigation_multicropping"

- priceAgg:

  Price aggregation: "GLO" for global average prices, or "ISO" for
  country-level prices, or "CONST" for same price for all crops

- iniyear:

  initialization year for food price and cropmix area

- selectyears:

  Years to be returned by the function

- yieldcalib:

  If TRUE: LPJmL yields calibrated to FAO country yield in iniyear Also
  needs specification of refYields, separated by ":". Options: FALSE
  (for single cropping analyses) or "TRUE:actual:irrig_crop" (for
  multiple cropping analyses) If FALSE: uncalibrated LPJmL yields are
  used

- multicropping:

  Multicropping activated (TRUE) or not (FALSE) and Multiple Cropping
  Suitability mask selected (mask can be: "none": no mask applied (only
  for development purposes) "actual:total": currently multicropped areas
  calculated from total harvested areas and total physical areas per
  cell from readLandInG "actual:crop" (crop-specific),
  "actual:irrigation" (irrigation-specific), "actual:irrig_crop" (crop-
  and irrigation-specific) "total" "potential:endogenous": potentially
  multicropped areas given temperature and productivity limits
  "potential:exogenous": potentially multicropped areas given GAEZ
  suitability classification) (e.g. TRUE:actual:total; TRUE:none; FALSE)
