# calcMissingWater

Calculates difference between requested water and water that can be
fulfilled in algorithm given available surface water resources for all
scenarios. This information is used to derive non-renewable groundwater
use.

## Usage

``` r
calcMissingWater(
  output,
  lpjml,
  climatetype,
  transDistGW = 100,
  multicropping = "TRUE:actual:irrig_crop",
  selectyears,
  iniyear
)
```

## Arguments

- output:

  sector to be reported: non-agricultural sector water use ("nonAg"),
  (committed) agricultural water use ("comAg"), or both ("total")

- lpjml:

  LPJmL version used

- climatetype:

  Switch between different climate scenarios or historical baseline
  "GSWP3-W5E5:historical"

- transDistGW:

  Water transport distance allowed to fulfill locally unfulfilled water
  demand by surrounding cell water availability to determine missing
  water that is tagged as non-renewable groundwater

- multicropping:

  Multicropping activated (TRUE) or not (FALSE) and Multiple Cropping
  Suitability mask selected (mask can be: "none": no mask applied (only
  for development purposes) "actual:total": currently multicropped areas
  calculated from total harvested areas and total physical areas per
  cell from LandInG "actual:crop" (crop-specific), "actual:irrigation"
  (irrigation-specific), "actual:irrig_crop" (crop- and
  irrigation-specific) "total" "potential:endogenous": potentially
  multicropped areas given temperature and productivity limits
  "potential:exogenous": potentially multicropped areas given GAEZ
  suitability classification) (e.g. TRUE:actual:total; TRUE:none; FALSE)

- selectyears:

  Years to be returned

- iniyear:

  Initialization year
