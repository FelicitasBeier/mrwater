# fullMULTICROPPING

Function that produces output for multiple cropping and irrigation
potentials on current cropland at cellular resolution.

## Usage

``` r
fullMULTICROPPING(
  allocationrule = "optimization",
  comAg = TRUE,
  fossilGW = TRUE,
  transDist = 100
)
```

## Arguments

- allocationrule:

  Rule to be applied for river basin discharge allocation across cells
  of river basin ("optimization", "upstreamfirst")

- comAg:

  if TRUE: the currently already irrigated areas in initialization year
  are reserved for irrigation, if FALSE: no irrigation areas reserved
  (irrigation potential)

- fossilGW:
