# mrwater Documentation

## Overview

The following document provides a full code documentation of the
`mrwater` library including a range of arguments that can be varied to
produce cellular pre-processed water-related outputs. The `fullWATER.R`
gives an overview of functions generating the main model outputs. It can
be executed with the function call `madrat:::retrieveData(WATER)` that
will generate a .tgz file with all relevant outputs.

### Related libraries

The `mrwater` library is part of the mr-universe. For more details to
the related libraries, please have a look at the respective libraries:

``` r

library(madrat)
library(magclass)
library(mrcommons)
library(mrland)
```

### Input data

The `mrwater` library relies on a range of input data. Open-source data
is directly downloaded and imported via `downloadSource` and
`readSource` functions that are part of the `madrat` library. Data that
is not openly available needs to be stored in a specific folder
structure (`inputdata/sources/DataSource`) where the respective
DataSource folder must have the same name as the `readSource` function
(e.g. readRamankutty refers to the inputdata/sources/Ramankutty folder).
The read functions of this library and the underlying libraries
necessary to run the code (e.g. `mrwater:::readIrrigationSystem`;
`mrcommons:::readFAO`; `mrland:::readZabel2014`) access this folder to
include the required data.

## Motivation

The mrwater library can be used to generate stand-alone spatially
explicit irrigation potentials (irrigation water potentials (withdrawals
and consumption) and irrigation area potentials) and (aggregated) input
data for land-system models. Potential aggregation units are spatial
clusters (based on bio-physical similarity of grid cells), country- or
basin-scale.

Furthermore, its outputs are a useful disaggregation tool for
land-system model outputs. For example irrigation water withdrawals from
land-use models such as MAgPIE can be disaggregated to a 0.5-degree
spatial resolution using spatially explicit irrigation potentials.

It is designed as hydrological input data processing tool for the global
land-use model MAgPIE (Model of Agricultural Production and its Impact
on the Environment). Nevertheless, it is applicable for other
land-system models and its spatially explicit as well as aggregated
outputs can be used for a variety of land-system models (e.g. CGEs, PEs,
etc.).

Note: To return spatially explicit function outputs, the
`madrat:::calcOutput()` function call must include the argument
`aggregate = FALSE`. For aggregation, a mapping is required.

## Hydrological input data

In this version of the mrwater library, all hydrological input data is
provided by the process-based hydrology-vegetation model LPJmL. Data
that is based on natural vegetation runs is provided by LPJmL4. Data
that includes management is based on LPJmL5.

The river routing consists of several functions. The first iteration
determines naturalized discharge based on yearly runoff and lake
evaporation using the STN river structure
(`rs <- readRDS(system.file("extdata/riverstructure_stn_coord.rds", package = "mrwater"))`)
that determines the flow direction and basin attribution of the 67420
grid cells of the underlying land mask. The function returns natural
discharge and lake evaporation that are required for further
calculations in the river routing routine.

``` r

natQ <- calcOutput("RiverNaturalFlows", selectyears = 2010,
                    climatetype = "GFDL-ESM4:ssp126",
                    lpjml = c(natveg = "LPJmL4_for_MAgPIE_44ac93de",
                    crop = "ggcmi_phase3_nchecks_9ca735cb"), aggregate = FALSE)[, , "discharge_nat"]
```

The required arguments are `selectyears` (determining the year(s) for
which the output shall be generated), `climatetype` (selecting the GCM
data and scenario underlying the process-based vegetation model), and
`lpjml` (selecting the LPJmL model versions used for natural vegetation
(`natveg`) input data and management (`crop`) input data)

Environmental flow requirements (EFRs) and accessible discharge are also
calculated based on hydrological LPJmL data only. Both are based on
monthly discharge. The calculation method and strictness of EFR can be
selected via the `efrMethod` argument (e.g. “Smakhtin:good”,
“VMF:fair”). Inaccessible discharge is based on the assumption that the
higher the long-term seasonal variability of discharge is, the harder it
is to access the water by humans and bring it into productive use.
Different accessibility rules can be selected via the
`accessibilityrule` argument (e.g. “CV:2” stands for the coefficient of
variation approach to a base of 2; “Q:75” stands for a quantile approach
where discharge that exceeds the 75th quantile is inaccessible to
humans).

``` r

selectyears <- 2010
lpjml       <- c(natveg = "LPJmL4_for_MAgPIE_44ac93de", crop = "ggcmi_phase3_nchecks_bft_6277d36e")
climatetype <- "GFDL-ESM4:ssp126"

efr <- calcOutput("EnvmtlFlowRequirements", efrMethod = "VMF:fair",
                  selectyears = selectyears, climatetype = climatetype, lpjml = lpjml,
                  aggregate = FALSE)[, , "EFR"]

inaccessibleQ <- calcOutput("DischargeInaccessible", accessibilityrule = "CV:2",
                            selectyears = selectyears, climatetype = climatetype, lpjml = lpjml,
                            aggregate = FALSE)

efrMethod         <- "VMF:fair"
accessibilityrule <- "CV:2"
```

Note: The integration of alternative biophysical and hydrological input
data is possible.

## Human water use data

Human water abstractions are considered in consecutive river routing
iterations that reserve the respective water abstraction and update
cellular discharge respectively. They are determined through the
following function call:

``` r

humanQ <- calcOutput("RiverDischargeNatAndHuman", iniyear = 2010, comAg = TRUE,
                     selectyears = selectyears, multicropping = FALSE,
                     climatetype = climatetype, lpjml = lpjml,
                     efrMethod = efrMethod, aggregate = FALSE)

iniyear <- 2010
comAg   <- TRUE
```

Non-agricultural water abstractions as provided by ISIMIP (and for
future scenarios WATERGAP) have priority over agricultural water
abstractions. They are determined through the function call
`calcOutput("RiverHumanUses", humanuse = "non_agriculture", ...)` and
report reserved non-agricultural water consumption (“currHuman_wc”) and
withdrawal (“currHuman_ww”).

Taking so-called “committed agricultural uses”, i.e. reserving water
abstractions of currently irrigated areas, into account is optional (it
can be activated via the `com_ag` argument). In case of an activation of
committed agricultural uses, the required consumption and withdrawal for
currently irrigated areas as determined in
`calcOutput("WaterUseCommittedAg", ...)` are reserved in addition to
non-agricultural water abstractions via the function call
`calcOutput("RiverHumanUses", humanuse = "committed_agriculture", ..., iniyear = 2010)`.
The argument `iniyear` determines the chosen cellular irrigated crop mix
(i.e. the crop mix as reported by FAOSTAT for the year 2010 on cellular
cropland as reported by LUH2). Cellular irrigated areas for specific
years are provided via
`calcOutput("Croparea", years = iniyear, sectoral = "kcr", physical = TRUE, cells = "lpjcell", cellular = TRUE, irrigation = TRUE, aggregate = FALSE)`
through combining (irrigated and rainfed) cropland area provided by LUH2
and country-level FAO crop production data. Note that areas reported as
irrigated depreciate at a rate of 10 percent per annum for future time
steps (years after `iniyear`).

Compared to the previous section, this section requires additional input
data: ISIMIP non-agricultural water abstraction data (for the historical
time period and fixed at this level for the future), WATERGAP
non-agricultural water abstraction data (for future scenarios), LPJmL5
crop water requirements, country level irrigation system shares as
provided by Jägermeyr (2015), LUH2 cellular cropland area (see also:
`mrcommons:::calcLUH2v2`), and FAO country-level crop-specific
production data (see also: `mrcommons:::readFAO_online`).

## Land-use input data

Spatial-explicit land-use and irrigation area data provided by LUH2 (see
also `mrcommons:::calcLUH2v2`). Since the LUH2 cropland map is
subdivided into only five crop functional types (C3 annuals; C4 annuals;
C3 perennials; C4 perennials; C3 nitrogen fixers), we use the spatial
distribution of LUH2 and FAOSTAT information on total country-level
crop-specific production to derive spatially-explicit crop-specific
areas (see `mrcommons:::calcCroparea`). The country-level FAOSTAT
cropmix is distributed equally across physical cropland of the
respective country while maintaining the spatially explicit cropland
area distribution as provided by LUH2. The distribution of rice area is
derived more explicitly. LUH2 provides cellular flooded area shares and
only rice is flooded according to the data set. The distribution of
physical rice areas is therefore determined by assigning the country’s
rice production to flooded areas provided at cellular level by LUH2.
Aerobic (non-paddy) rice is accounted by distributing country-level FAO
rice areas beyond country-aggregated LUH2 flooded area (i.e. where FAO
reports higher country-level rice areas than there are LUH2 flooded
areas in the respective country) equally across the remaining country’s
cropland area. Note that flooded areas are not accounted as irrigated
areas. For one, because flooded rice production is often only partially
irrigated and also because it fulfills a special management purpose in
terms of pest control.

``` r

croparea <- calcOutput("Croparea", years = iniyear, sectoral = "kcr",
physical = TRUE, cells = "lpjcell", cellular = TRUE, irrigation = TRUE, aggregate = FALSE)
```

The `physical` argument determines accounts for the cropping intensity
in that `physical = TRUE` returns cropland areas that match physical
area. With `physical = FALSE` croparea can exceed physical land area,
due to multicropping.

## Irrigation Water Potentials (IWP)

Finally, the function `calcRiverSurplusDischargeAllocation` determines
the allocation of “surplus discharge”, i.e. the discharge of the estuary
cell that is not (yet) consumed along the river in the last iteration of
the previous river routings that reserved environmental and human water
uses. The function returns the water that is potentially available for
irrigation considering biophysical, economic and management constraints.

``` r

iwp <- calcOutput("RiverDischargeAllocation", output = "potIrrigWat",
                   selectyears = selectyears, climatetype = climatetype, lpjml = lpjml,
                   efrMethod = efrMethod, accessibilityrule = accessibilityrule,
                   iniyear = iniyear, com_ag = com_ag,
                   allocationrule = "optimization",
                   rankmethod = "USD_ha:TRUE", yieldcalib = TRUE, cropmix = "hist_total",
                   thresholdtype = "USD_ha", gainthreshold = 500,
                   landScen = "potCropland:HalfEarth",
                   irrigationsystem = "initialization", multicropping = FALSE, aggregate = FALSE)
```

### Alternative allocation algortihms

The `mrwater` library includes different surplus discharge allocation
rules representing different management strategies (“upstreamfirst”
vs. “optimization”) that can be set in the `allocationrule` argument.
The upstreamfirst algorithm allows irrigation water abstractions
provided that there is sufficient local discharge available and a
positive yield gain through irrigation reserving these irrigation water
abstractions in upstream grid cells first following the calculation
order of cells from upstream to downstream (for more details on the
river structure and calculation order see `riverstructure.Rmd`). The
optimization algorithm ranks grid cells according to their yield value
gain through irrigation allocating available local discharge to the grid
cell with the highest productivity first, such that water resources are
made available at the most efficient location rather than upstream
before downstream.

### Economic yield value gains

The yield value gain can be expressed in USD per hectare irrigated area
or USD per cubic meter of irrigation water set via the `unit` argument
in `calcIrrigYieldImprovementPotential` and via the `rankmethod`
argument in `calcRiverSurplusDischargeAllocation`. The `rankmethod`
argument consists of two components: the unit selections (“USD_ha” or
“USD_m3”) and a boolean determining whether grid cells are ranked
according to their full yield gain potential (TRUE) or taking a two step
approach ranking according to their 75% potential and their full
potential allocating 50% of irrigation water requirements in each of the
two iterations (FALSE) separated by a “:”.

The yield gain through irrigation - as calculated from LPJmL5 irrigated
and rainfed yields - is valued with global average crop prices as
provided by FAOSTAT (see
`mrcommons:::calcOutput("IniFoodPrice", datasource = "FAO", products = "kcr", years = NULL, year = iniyear, aggregate = FALSE))`.

Depending on the modeling application, LPJmL irrigated and rainfed crop
yields can be calibrated to meet FAO crop yields via the `yieldcalib`
argument. The `cropmix` argument determines the selection of crops
(“hist_total” refers to the cellular cropmix as determined in
`calcCroparea` considering irrigated and rainfed areas, “hist_irrig”
refers to cellular cropmix as determined in `calcCroparea` considering
only irrigated areas. Besides these crop mixes, a selection of one or
several proxycrop(s) can be selected. This setting is relevant when
calculating irrigation potentials for the future).

``` r

yieldGain <- calcOutput("IrrigYieldImprovementPotential", unit = "USD_ha:GLO",
                        selectyears = selectyears,
                        climatetype = climatetype, lpjml = lpjml,
                        iniyear = iniyear,
                        cropmix = "hist_total", yieldcalib = TRUE,
                        multicropping = FALSE, aggregate = FALSE)
```

To represent economic aspects of irrigation, different yield value gain
thresholds can be chosen to calculate the respective IWP. It is set via
the arguments `thresholdtype` and `gainthreshold`. The chosen valuation
method is determined via the unit argument that determines whether water
or irrigation area is valued (USD_ha or USD_m3) and whether global
average prices (GLO) or country-level agricultural prices (ISO) are
used.

### Work-in-progress

Please refrain from using the `multicropping = TRUE` argument. This
implementation is still work-in-progress and will be updated soon.

### Cropland extent

The irrigation potentials can be calculated for various scenarios of
potential cropland cover that are set via the `landScen` argument. It
consists of two parts: (1) the potentially available land component
where currently irrigated area (currIrrig), current cropland area
(currCropland) or potential cropland area (potCropland) can be selected,
and (2) a protection component that selects which land areas shall be
protected, i.e. no irrigation taking place in these areas. Possible
selections are: WDPA, BH, FF, CPD, LW, BH_IFL, HalfEarth. For example
`landScen = "currCropland:NA"` selects current cropland extent as of the
year set in iniyear without land protection;
`landScen = "potIrrig:HalfEarth"` is potential cropland while respecting
a Half Earth land protection scenario.

### Irrigation Area Potential (IAP)

The `calcIrrigatableArea` function translates potential irrigation water
(PIW) into potentially irrigated areas (PIA) and returns the area that
can potentially be irrigated given the assumptions that are set via the
arguments.

``` r

allocationrule   <- "optimization"
rankmethod       <- "USD_ha:TRUE"
yieldcalib       <- TRUE
cropmix          <- "hist_total"
thresholdtype    <- "USD_ha"
gainthreshold    <- 500
landScen         <- "potCropland:HalfEarth"
irrigationsystem <- "initialization"
multicropping    <- FALSE

iap <- calcOutput("PotIrrigAreas", selectyears = selectyears, iniyear = iniyear,
                   lpjml = lpjml, climatetype = climatetype,
                   efrMethod = efrMethod, accessibilityrule = accessibilityrule,
                   rankmethod = rankmethod, yieldcalib = yieldcalib, allocationrule = allocationrule,
                   thresholdtype = thresholdtype, gainthreshold = gainthreshold,
                   irrigationsystem = irrigationsystem, landScen = landScen,
                   cropmix = cropmix, com_ag = com_ag,
                   potential_wat = TRUE, multicropping = FALSE, aggregate = FALSE)
```

### Generation of potential irrigation area (PIA) curves

For a representation of irrigation potentials at various irrigation
yield value gains, the river routing routine has to be executed for
varying irrigation yield value gain thresholds. The generated data can
be used to create PIA curves and/or aggregated to different scales
(e.g. country-, basin-scale).

``` r

iad <- calcOutput("EconOfIrrig", scenario = "ssp2", output = "IrrigArea",
             gtrange = c(0, 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 3000), selectyears = 2010, iniyear = 2010,
             lpjml = lpjml, climatetype = climatetype, efrMethod = efrMethod, accessibilityrule = accessibilityrule,
             rankmethod = rankmethod, yieldcalib = yieldcalib, transDist = transDist,
             allocationrule = allocationrule, thresholdtype = thresholdtype,
             irrigationsystem = irrigationsystem, landScen = landScen, cropmix = cropmix,
             potential_wat = TRUE, com_ag = FALSE, multicropping = FALSE, aggregate = FALSE)
```
