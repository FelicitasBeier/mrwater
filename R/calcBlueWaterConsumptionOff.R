#' @title       calcBlueWaterConsumptionOff
#' @description This function calculates consumptive blue water use for the whole year based on
#'              LPJmL blue water consumption of crops and the difference between rainfed and irrigated
#'              evapotranspiration of grass
#'
#' @param selectyears   Years to be returned
#' @param iniyear       Initialization year for filtering rules of data for regression
#' @param lpjml         LPJmL version required for respective inputs: natveg or crop
#' @param climatetype   Climate model (e.g., "MRI-ESM2-0:ssp370")
#'                      or historical baseline (e.g., "GSWP3-W5E5:historical")
#' @param interim       Interim output, i.e. the inputs to the blue water consumption regression
#'                      (TRUE:bconsCrop or TRUE:bconsGrass).
#'                      This is optional and only required for visualization purposes.
