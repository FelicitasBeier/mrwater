#' @param selectyears   Years to be returned
#' @param lpjml         LPJmL version required for respective inputs: natveg or crop
#' @param climatetype   Climate model or historical baseline "GSWP3-W5E5:historical"
#' @param multicropping Multicropping activated (TRUE) or not (FALSE) and
#'                      Multiple Cropping Suitability mask selected
#'                      (mask can be:

#'                                      and total physical areas per cell from LandInG
