#' @title       calcNonrenGroundwatUse
#' @description Calculates current non-renewable (fossil) groundwater use
#'              as negative difference between
#'              water availability from renewable sources and
#'              human water use (consumption and withdrawal).
#'              The water use in the initialization year is fixed in the future as
#'              non-renewable groundwater.
#'
#' @param output        "total": total groundwater use (non-agricultural and agricultural),
#'                      "nonAg": groundwater use in non-agricultural sector (industry, domestic, electricity),
#'                      "comAg": groundwater use in agricultural sector (currently irrigated area)
#' @param lpjml         LPJmL version used
#' @param climatetype   Switch between different climate scenarios or
#'                      historical baseline "GSWP3-W5E5:historical"
#' @param selectyears   Years to be returned
#' @param iniyear       Initialization year
#' @param transDistGW   Water transport distance allowed to fulfill locally
#'                      unfulfilled water demand by surrounding cell water availability
#'                      to determine missing water that is tagged as non-renewable groundwater
#' @param multicropping Multicropping activated (TRUE) or not (FALSE) and
#'                      Multiple Cropping Suitability mask selected
#'                      (mask can be:
#'                      "none": no mask applied (only for development purposes)
#'                      "actual:total": currently multicropped areas calculated from total harvested areas
#'                                      and total physical areas per cell from LandInG
#'                      "actual:crop" (crop-specific), "actual:irrigation" (irrigation-specific),
#'                      "actual:irrig_crop" (crop- and irrigation-specific) "total"
#'                      "potential:endogenous": potentially multicropped areas given
#'                                              temperature and productivity limits
#'                      "potential:exogenous": potentially multicropped areas given
#'                                             GAEZ suitability classification)
