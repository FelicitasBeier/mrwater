#' @title       calcBlueWaterConsumption
#' @description This function calculates consumptive blue water use for the whole year based on
#'              LPJmL blue water consumption of crops and the difference between rainfed and irrigated
#'              evapotranspiration of grass
#'
#' @param selectyears   Years to be returned
#' @param lpjml         LPJmL version required for respective inputs: natveg or crop
#' @param climatetype   Climate model (e.g., "MRI-ESM2-0:ssp370")
#'                      or historical baseline (e.g., "GSWP3-W5E5:historical")
#' @param fallowFactor  Factor determining water requirement reduction in off season due to
#'                      fallow period between harvest of first (main) season and
#'                      sowing of second (off) season
#' @param season        Season to be returned: "main" (LPJmL growing period),
#'                      "year" (entire year))
#' @param areaMask      Multicropping area mask to be used
#'                      "none": no mask applied (only for development purposes)

#'                                      and total physical areas per cell from readLandInG
