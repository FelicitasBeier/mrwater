#'
#' @param inLIST         List of objects that are inputs to the function:
#'                       previously reserved withdrawals and consumption in current cell;
#'                       currently requested withdrawal in current cell
#' @param inoutLIST      List of objects that are inputs to the function and
#'                       are updated by the function:
