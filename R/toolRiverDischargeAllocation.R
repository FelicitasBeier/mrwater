#' @description This tool function allocates discharge

#'              and various water constraints
#'
#' @param iteration      Currently active iteration of river discharge allocation.
#'                       Arguments:
#'                       "main" for case of main river cells
#'                       "neighbor" for case of neighboring cells of main river cells
#' @param transDist      Water transport distance allowed to fulfill locally
#'                       unfulfilled water demand by surrounding cell water availability
#' @param c              Current cell for which water shall be allocated
#' @param downCells      Downstream cells of c
#' @param neighborSelectCells Optionally: precomputed named list of neighbor-cell
#'                       downstream cells (only required for main allocation
#'                       with transDist != 0)
#' @param rs             River structure with information on upstreamcells,
#'                       downstreamcells and neighboring cells and distances
#' @param inLIST         List of objects that are inputs to the function
#'                       irrigGain, gainthreshold,
#' @param inoutLIST      List of objects that are inputs to the function and
#'                       are updated by the function
